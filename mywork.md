## Image processing

Computer sees the world as a grid of numbers.

Or more precisely, every pixel is a three number list. 

Each number on the list represent three colors: Red, Green, and Blue.

The biggest challenge is to understand the picture. What does it represent, how can we extract features and so on...

If we look the picture as a function then we can plot something like this:

- Point operators

  â€‹	- Pixel by pixel operator, be that: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and so on

  - Pixel transformation
  - Color transformation

- Correlation operators
  - Filtering and convolution
